CHILDHOOD -by MARKUS NATTEN 
The poet wonders hen he lost his childhood. He reflects that perhaps it as the day when he crossed the age of eleven. Maybe it was time when he realised that the concepts of Hell and Heaven, about which he had been taught since his childhood, did not exist in reality. Geography textbooks did not give the location of any such plans. The poet realises that he might have lost his childhood when he gained education and thus a rational outlook.

The poet reflects that maybe the loss of his childhood occurred when he was able to see through the hypocrisy of adults. These people followed double standards, with a difference in what they followed and what they preached. They told poet to be loving and caring; however, they themselves were argumentative, violent and discourteous. Their behaviour was a far cry from the love they sermonised about and advocated so reverently to the child.
The poet asks the same question again and again but with different options. He continues to guess when he actually lost his childhood. Perhaps, it as the day when he realised that his mind could think independently, forming his own opinions and being able to take his own decisions. He gained a sense of individuality, which set him free from the preconceived opinions of others. His own individual opinions and experiences shape his thoughts now and he realised that this might have been the time when he lost his childhood innocence completely.
The poet changes his question. The poet wonders where his childhood has gone. He realises that he lost his childhood to a forgotten place. He says that his childhood can only be found by looking at the innocent face of a child who does not have any pretensions and rationality and who trusts others unconditionally. In other words, a small child is full of innocence and there one can find one's own childhood.
